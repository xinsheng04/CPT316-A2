# Welcome to the digit classifier application!
## This application accepts a handwritten digit and predicts it's value using a keras NN
## It is created to satisfy the requirements of CPT316 - A2

Tech stack: Node-Red, Python, Keras, Scikit-learn, tensorflow

Execution instructions:
---Activating Node-red---
1. Get the root directory of this project, for example, C:\Users\Asus\OneDrive\Desktop\myProjects\Y3S1\CPT 316\a2
2. In your PowerShell cmd (Windows Powershell) paste cd [your-root-directory] to switch to that root directory
- For example, cd 'C:\Users\Asus\OneDrive\Desktop\myProjects\Y3S1\CPT 316\a2'
3. In that very same directory, run node-red and open Node-red in the browser
---Activating the predictor function---
4. Open another cmd prompt (Windows PowerShell) in the same root directory. For example, you can do it in VSCode
5. run python predict.py
6. Wait for the words " * Debugger is active! * Debugger PIN: 361-710-501" to appear in the cmd prompt
7. Open the ui in the dashboard
8. Draw and predict away!

Note: Digit prediction is not 100% accurate.
